8 jin sabre
When practising the Sabre, we employ movements such as spring up, shift, dodge and display.
The sabre is entwined like a belt round the waist and then shoots out; when the steps change
the body shifts; advance one step, withdraw one step; chop once, cut once. Hand and sabre in
conjunction; coil and spin, rise and fall; like a long rainbow passing through the skies. Like a
swirling wind rotating snowflakes.
Pi to chop/split from various angles
Ci to stab/pierce
Tan to search out, slashing upwards to the groin
Tou to push up left hand supporting the blade
Ti to lift an upward diversion
Liao to stir diversion and slash in a continuous movement
Chen to sink diverting an attack by pressing downwards
Lu to divert an attack to the side

14.Plum blossom opens five petals
15.Celestial horse walks the skies
16.The completion style
When training the Spear, adhere, connect, entwine and stab; one lift, one hit; one drag, one dot.
Obstruct and cut, rapid and intense; in the midst of fullness, conceal emptiness. Like a snake coiling
and striking; or like a willow tree swaying in the wind. In the finest stage, the changes can be infinite.
In the spear we use Peng, Lu, Ji, An as the warp (vertical and horizontal) and Tiao, Tan, Qian, Dian as
the woof (diagonal). This means that the spear should be used in a three dimensional way and not
flat, so we can defend and counter from any angle.
peng-using force in a upward direction
lu-use of force to either side
ji-use of force straight and to the front
an-downward use of force
tiao-is to lift or stir up, usually exposing the opponents
body head or limbs for a counter attack by coming underneth his weapon.
tan-is to rebound i.e off the opponents weapon into a thrust or strike simultaneously making him lose
his grip on or control over his weapon
qian-dragging/pulling thus spiralling or entwining the spear causing the opponent to lose balance or
control of his weapon
dian-is to dot or thrust focusing all the force on just one point.

8 jin sword
When practising the Sword, the actions employed are chopping, stirring, stroking and stabbing. The
techniques are finely linked together. One drawing forth (of opponents attack) and one strike; one
flourish and one presentation.
The body follows the movements of the sword which circles the body and can be seen on every
direction. Lithe and graceful, surprising and subtle; body and sword are as one. Like a Spiritual
Dragon, speeding like an arrow, or a male phoenix soaring and circling in the air.
Kan- to chop/slice diagonally downwards
Liao- to stir divert and slash in one continuous movement
Mo- to stroke subtle circular diversion
Ci- to stab/pierce
Chou- to draw forth diverting upwards with a whipping action
Ti- to lift an upward diversion
Heng- to sweep across horizontal diversion followed by thrust
Dao- to invert diverting to the side, sword pointed down
