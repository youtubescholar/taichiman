Choreography 1
------------------------------------------------

Sequence Steps:
1. Bow: Start with a respectful bow to center yourself and show respect to the practice space.
2. Horse Stance: Transition into a horse stance, placing your feet wider than shoulder-width apart, toes facing forward, and knees bent.
3. Double Punch: From the horse stance, deliver a left punch followed by a right punch, aiming straight ahead at chest level.
4.  Front Kick Right: Shift your weight slightly to the left, and perform a right front kick, snapping the foot out and back, targeting an imaginary mid-level target.
5.  Front Kick Left: After retracting the right front kick, perform a left front kick with the same precision and control.
6.  Right Roundhouse Kick: Turn to your right, pivoting on your left foot, and execute a roundhouse kick with your right leg, targeting torso height.
7.  Left Roundhouse Kick: After placing the right foot down, pivot on the right foot and perform a roundhouse kick with your left leg.
8.  Low Block Right: Return to your original stance and perform a right low block, defending against an imaginary low strike.
9.  High Block Left: Immediately follow with a left high block, imagining blocking an overhead attack.
10. Step Forward Jab: Step forward with your left foot, bringing your body into a left forward stance, and execute a quick jab with the left hand.
11. Reverse Punch Right: Without pausing, deliver a strong reverse punch with your right hand while maintaining your stance.
12. Final Bow: Finish the sequence by stepping your right foot back to meet your left, stand up straight, and bow to signify the completion and respect for your practice.
