Choreography 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Sequence Steps:
1. Bow: Start with a respectful bow to show discipline and prepare mentally for the sequence.
2. Attention Stance: Stand straight with your feet together and hands at your sides, focusing on your posture.

3. Step into Fighting Stance: Step out with your left foot, bending both knees slightly, hands up to guard.
4. Front Kick (Right): Perform a simple front kick with your right leg, keeping the kick at waist height and returning to the fighting stance.

5. Knee Raise (Left): Lift your left knee towards your chest to mimic a knee strike, focusing on balance.
6. Side Kick (Left): Gently execute a side kick with your left leg, pushing out slowly to maintain control and not aiming too high.

7. Switch Stance: Swap your stance so your right foot is forward and your left foot back, readying for another movement.
8. Front Kick (Left): Complete the sequence with a left front kick, again aiming no higher than waist height and focusing on form and balance.
    
Continue this sequence and Cool Down as needed
