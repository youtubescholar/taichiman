Starting Position:

Begin in a kneeling position on your yoga mat. Kneel upright with your thighs perpendicular to the floor and your hips directly over your knees.
Positioning the Legs:

Extend your right leg out to the side with your foot flat on the floor and your toes pointing forward. Your right leg should be in line with your left knee.
Keep your left knee and shin firmly grounded on the mat.
Spine and Hip Alignment:

Square your hips forward and lengthen your spine. Ensure that your torso remains upright and avoid leaning forward or backward.
Engage your core muscles to support your lower back and maintain stability.
Arm and Hand Placement:

Inhale and extend your arms out to the sides at shoulder height, parallel to the floor, with your palms facing down.
As you exhale, reach your right arm down towards your right leg and place your hand on your shin, ankle, or the floor, depending on your flexibility.
Upper Body Alignment:

Extend your left arm overhead with your palm facing down, creating a long line from your left heel to your left fingertips.
Keep your chest open and avoid collapsing your ribcage. Twist slightly to open your chest towards the ceiling.
Maintaining Proper Alignment:

Ensure that your hips remain squared to the front and avoid twisting them.
Keep your neck in line with your spine and gaze upward or forward, depending on your comfort level.
Breathing:

Take slow, deep breaths. Inhale to lengthen your spine and create space, and exhale to deepen the stretch.
Use your breath to help release any tension and maintain a steady focus.
Modifications for Comfort:

If you experience discomfort in your knees, place a folded blanket or cushion under your kneeling knee for additional support.
Use a block under your hand for support if you cannot comfortably reach your shin or the floor.
Mindfulness and Relaxation:

Focus on your breath and body sensations. Use this pose to connect with your inner self and find calmness.
Stay present in the moment and avoid pushing yourself too hard. Listen to your body and respect your limits.
Duration:

Hold the pose for several breaths, typically 30 seconds to 1 minute.
Gradually increase the duration as your flexibility and comfort improve.
Exiting the Pose:

To come out of the pose, inhale to lift your torso back to an upright position.
Bring your extended leg back to a kneeling position and repeat the pose on the other side.
Contraindications:

Avoid this pose if you have knee, hip, or shoulder injuries. Always listen to your body and modify the pose as needed.
Consult with a healthcare professional if you have any concerns or pre-existing conditions that may be affected by this pose.
