Starting Position:

Begin in a kneeling position on your yoga mat. Place blocks on either side of your mat for support.
Warm-Up:

Ensure you are thoroughly warmed up before attempting Hanumanasana. Warm up with poses like Low Lunge (Anjaneyasana), Runnerâ€™s Lunge, and Pyramid Pose (Parsvottanasana) to prepare your hamstrings and hip flexors.
Entering the Pose:

From a kneeling position, step your right foot forward into a low lunge.
Slowly begin to slide your right foot forward and your left foot backward, straightening both legs as you lower your hips towards the mat.
Supporting Your Hips:

Use blocks under your hands for support as you lower into the pose. You can also place a block or bolster under your pelvis to support your hips if you cannot reach the floor.
Hip and Leg Alignment:

Ensure that your hips are squared to the front. Avoid letting your hips twist or tilt.
Keep your front leg straight with your kneecap pointing upwards and your back leg straight with the top of your foot pressing into the mat.
Spine Alignment:

Keep your spine long and upright. Avoid rounding your back or collapsing your chest.
Engage your core muscles to support your lower back and maintain balance.
Arm and Hand Placement:

Place your hands on blocks, on the mat, or lift them up overhead, depending on your flexibility and balance.
Keep your shoulders relaxed and away from your ears.
Breathing:

Take slow, deep breaths. Inhale to lengthen your spine and create space, and exhale to relax into the stretch.
Use your breath to help release any tension and deepen the pose gradually.
Modifications for Comfort:

Use props such as blocks, bolsters, or blankets to support your body and make the pose more accessible.
If you cannot reach the full split, practice a variation by keeping your front leg bent and only sliding as far as you comfortably can.
Mindfulness and Relaxation:

Focus on your breath and body sensations. Use this pose to connect with your inner self and find calmness.
Avoid pushing yourself too hard. Listen to your body and respect your limits to prevent injury.
Exiting the Pose:

To come out of the pose, press your hands into the mat or blocks for support and slowly slide your front foot back into a kneeling position.
Repeat the pose on the other side, stepping your left foot forward and sliding your right foot back.
Contraindications:

Avoid this pose if you have injuries in your hamstrings, hips, or knees.
Consult with a healthcare professional if you have any concerns or pre-existing conditions that may be affected by this pose.
Modifications and Variations:
For Beginners: Use plenty of props to support your body. Practice variations with bent knees to build flexibility gradually.
For Advanced Practitioners: Try reaching your arms overhead and arching your back slightly for a deeper stretch.
