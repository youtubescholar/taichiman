Starting Position:

Begin in Mountain Pose (Tadasana), standing tall with your feet together and arms at your sides. Engage your core and distribute your weight evenly on both feet.
Transition into Warrior III:

From Mountain Pose, step your right foot back into a high lunge position, bending your left knee and aligning it over your left ankle. Your right heel is lifted, and your legs are strong and active.
Arm and Hand Placement:

Extend your arms forward alongside your ears with your palms facing each other, or keep your hands at your heart in Anjali Mudra (prayer position) if that feels more stable.
Engaging the Core:

Engage your core muscles to stabilize your spine and support your lower back. Keep your hips squared to the mat and avoid letting them tilt or twist.
Lifting the Back Leg:

On an exhale, shift your weight onto your left leg and begin to lift your right leg off the ground, extending it straight back. Your right leg should be parallel to the floor, or as high as you can comfortably lift it while keeping your hips level.
Alignment of the Body:

Your body should form a straight line from the fingertips to the lifted foot. Your torso, arms, and lifted leg are parallel to the floor.
Keep your standing leg strong and slightly bent if necessary to maintain balance and avoid hyperextension of the knee.
Foot and Leg Alignment:

Point your right toes straight back and flex your foot to keep the leg active. Your standing leg should remain firm and strong.
Ensure your weight is evenly distributed on the standing foot, pressing through all four corners of the foot.
Head and Neck Position:

Keep your head in line with your spine, gazing down at the floor a few feet in front of you to maintain balance.
Avoid lifting your head too high or dropping it too low, which can strain your neck.
Breathing:

Take slow, deep breaths. Inhale to lengthen your spine and create space, and exhale to engage your core and stabilize the pose.
Use your breath to help maintain focus and balance.
Modifications for Comfort and Stability:

If you find it challenging to balance, practice with your hands on a wall or use a chair for support.
Use a yoga block under your hands if you cannot comfortably reach the floor.
Mindfulness and Focus:

Focus on a fixed point (drishti) to help maintain your balance. Use this pose to build strength, concentration, and focus.
Avoid pushing yourself too hard. Listen to your body and respect your limits.
Duration:

Hold the pose for several breaths, typically 15-30 seconds. Gradually increase the duration as your strength and balance improve.
Exiting the Pose:

To come out of the pose, gently lower your right leg back to the floor and return to the high lunge position.
Step your right foot forward to meet your left and return to Mountain Pose. Repeat the pose on the other side, stepping your left foot back.
Contraindications:

Avoid this pose if you have severe balance issues, ankle injuries, or lower back problems. Always listen to your body and modify the pose as needed.
Consult with a healthcare professional if you have any concerns or pre-existing conditions that may be affected by this pose.
Modifications and Variations:
For Beginners: Use a wall for support or keep your hands at your heart in Anjali Mudra.
For a Deeper Challenge: Extend your arms forward alongside your ears and lift your back leg higher while keeping your hips level.
