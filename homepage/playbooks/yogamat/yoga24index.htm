Starting Position:

Begin in Mountain Pose (Tadasana) with your feet together and your arms at your sides. Stand tall, distributing your weight evenly on both feet.
Finding Balance:

Shift your weight onto your left foot, pressing firmly into the mat. Engage your left leg muscles to create a stable foundation.
Lift your right foot off the ground and bring the sole of your right foot to the inner left thigh, calf, or ankle. Avoid placing the foot directly on the knee.
Foot and Leg Alignment:

Press your right foot into your left thigh, calf, or ankle, and press your left leg back into your right foot to create mutual support and stability.
Keep your left leg strong and straight, with a slight bend in the knee if needed for balance.
Hip and Pelvis Positioning:

Square your hips forward and ensure that your pelvis remains level.
Engage your core muscles to support your lower back and maintain alignment.
Arm and Hand Placement:

Bring your hands together in front of your heart in Anjali Mudra (prayer position) to start.
For a deeper stretch, extend your arms overhead with your palms facing each other or touching. Keep your shoulders relaxed and away from your ears.
Spine and Head Alignment:

Lengthen your spine, lifting through the crown of your head. Avoid arching your back or leaning forward.
Keep your gaze (drishti) fixed on a point in front of you to help maintain balance.
Breathing:

Take slow, deep breaths. Inhale to lengthen your spine and create space, and exhale to relax into the pose.
Use your breath to help maintain focus and stability.
Modifications for Comfort and Stability:

If you find it challenging to balance, practice near a wall or use a chair for support.
Keep your right toes on the floor and your heel against your left ankle for a more accessible variation.
Mindfulness and Relaxation:

Focus on your breath and body sensations. Use this pose to connect with your inner self and cultivate a sense of grounding and balance.
Stay present in the moment and avoid pushing yourself too hard. Listen to your body and respect your limits.
Duration:

Hold the pose for several breaths, typically 15-30 seconds. Gradually increase the duration as your balance and strength improve.
Exiting the Pose:

To come out of the pose, slowly lower your right foot back to the mat and return to Mountain Pose.
Repeat the pose on the other side, shifting your weight onto your right foot and lifting your left foot.
Contraindications:

Avoid this pose if you have severe balance issues or ankle injuries. Always listen to your body and modify the pose as needed.
Consult with a healthcare professional if you have any concerns or pre-existing conditions that may be affected by this pose.
Modifications and Variations:
For Beginners: Keep your toes on the floor and your heel against your opposite ankle. Use a wall for support if needed.
For a Deeper Stretch: Extend your arms overhead and bring your palms together. Experiment with different arm variations to challenge your balance.
