Starting Position:

Begin lying face down on your yoga mat with your legs extended straight back and the tops of your feet pressing into the mat.
Position your hands alongside your lower ribs, with your elbows bent and pointing upwards.
Foot and Leg Alignment:

Keep your feet hip-width apart and press the tops of your feet firmly into the mat.
Engage your quadriceps to lift your kneecaps and keep your legs active.
Hand and Arm Placement:

Place your hands firmly on the mat alongside your lower ribs, fingers spread wide and pressing evenly.
Straighten your arms, pressing firmly through your hands to lift your chest off the mat.
Lifting the Torso:

Inhale deeply as you press through your hands and lift your chest up, extending your arms fully.
Lift your thighs and hips off the mat, balancing on the tops of your feet and your hands.
Spine and Hip Alignment:

Lengthen through your spine, lifting your chest forward and up.
Keep your shoulders relaxed and away from your ears, broadening your collarbones and opening your chest.
Ensure your hips are squared and not sagging. Your legs should remain active and engaged.
Head and Neck Position:

Keep your head in line with your spine, gazing straight ahead or slightly upward.
Avoid letting your head drop back too far, which can strain your neck.
Breathing:

Take slow, deep breaths. Inhale to lift and lengthen your spine, and exhale to deepen into the stretch.
Use your breath to help relax any tension and maintain focus.
Modifications for Comfort and Stability:

If you experience discomfort in your lower back or wrists, lower your thighs to the mat for a gentler version (Cobra Pose).
Place a folded blanket under your thighs or use a strap around your thighs to help support the lift if needed.
Mindfulness and Relaxation:

Focus on your breath and body sensations. Use this pose to open your chest and stretch your front body.
Stay present in the moment and avoid pushing yourself too hard. Listen to your body and respect your limits.
Duration:

Hold the pose for several breaths, typically 15-30 seconds.
Gradually increase the duration as your strength and flexibility improve.
Exiting the Pose:

To come out of the pose, exhale and slowly lower your body back to the mat.
Transition into Childâ€™s Pose (Balasana) to release any tension in your back.
Contraindications:

Avoid this pose if you have severe wrist, shoulder, or lower back injuries. Always listen to your body and modify the pose as needed.
Consult with a healthcare professional if you have any concerns or pre-existing conditions that may be affected by this pose.
Modifications and Variations:
For Beginners: Lower your thighs to the mat for Cobra Pose if you find it difficult to lift your entire body.
For a Deeper Stretch: Lift your chest higher and engage your legs more fully to deepen the backbend.
