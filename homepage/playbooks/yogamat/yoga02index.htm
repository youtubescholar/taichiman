Set Up Your Space:

Use a yoga mat to provide cushioning for your sit bones.
Have props such as blankets, bolsters, or blocks nearby to support your knees or back if needed.
Seated Position:

Sit with your legs extended in front of you, then bend your knees and bring the soles of your feet together.
Draw your heels in towards your pelvis, but only as far as is comfortable. Let your knees drop out to the sides, forming a diamond shape with your legs.
Supporting Your Knees:

If your knees are high off the ground and feel strained, place blocks, bolsters, or folded blankets underneath them for support. This reduces pressure on the inner thighs and groin.
Spine Alignment:

Sit up tall, lengthening your spine. Avoid rounding your back by engaging your core muscles.
Imagine a string pulling the crown of your head towards the ceiling to maintain a straight and elongated posture.
Hand Placement:

Hold your feet or ankles gently with your hands. Alternatively, you can place your hands on the floor behind you for additional support.
Breathing:

Focus on deep, even breaths. Inhale to lengthen your spine and exhale to relax into the stretch.
Use your breath to help release any tension in your hips and inner thighs.
Forward Bend (Optional):

If you feel comfortable and want a deeper stretch, hinge at your hips and fold forward. Keep your spine long and avoid rounding your back.
You can rest your elbows on your thighs or on the floor in front of you.
Adjustments for Comfort:

If you feel discomfort in your lower back, sit on a folded blanket or cushion to elevate your hips slightly.
Ensure that you are not forcing your knees down; let gravity and time help you deepen the stretch naturally.
Mindfulness and Relaxation:

Close your eyes and focus on your breath and body sensations. Use this time to connect with your body and mind.
Stay in the pose for several breaths or up to a few minutes, depending on your comfort level.
Exiting the Pose:

To come out of the pose, gently lift your knees together and extend your legs out in front of you.
Shake out your legs to release any remaining tension.
