Starting Position:

Begin in a seated position with your legs extended straight in front of you and your hands resting on the floor beside your hips.
Sit on a folded blanket or cushion if you need extra support for your lower back.
Engaging the Core:

Sit up tall, lengthening your spine and lifting your chest. Engage your core muscles by drawing your navel towards your spine.
Keep your spine straight and avoid rounding your back as you move into the pose.
Leg Positioning:

Bend your knees and place your feet flat on the floor.
Lift your feet off the floor, bringing your shins parallel to the mat. Your knees should be bent at a 90-degree angle.
Arm and Hand Placement:

Extend your arms forward, parallel to the floor, with your palms facing each other. Keep your arms straight but relaxed.
If extending your arms is challenging, you can hold onto the backs of your thighs for support.
Spine and Hip Alignment:

Maintain a long spine and avoid collapsing your chest. Lift your chest towards the ceiling to help keep your back straight.
Ensure that your hips are level and your sit bones are grounded on the mat.
Extending the Legs:

For a more advanced variation, straighten your legs to form a "V" shape with your body. Keep your core engaged to support your lower back.
Flex your feet and press through your heels, keeping your legs active and strong.
Breathing:

Take slow, deep breaths. Inhale to lengthen your spine and create space, and exhale to engage your core and stabilize the pose.
Use your breath to help maintain balance and focus.
Modifications for Comfort:

If you experience discomfort in your lower back, keep your knees bent and your hands on the floor or the backs of your thighs for support.
To make the pose more accessible, you can practice with your feet on the floor and lift one foot at a time.
Mindfulness and Focus:

Focus on your breath and body sensations. Use this pose to build strength and concentration.
Avoid pushing yourself too hard. Listen to your body and respect your limits to prevent injury.
Duration:

Hold the pose for several breaths, typically 5-10 deep breaths.
Gradually increase the duration as your strength and balance improve.
Exiting the Pose:

To come out of the pose, exhale and slowly lower your feet to the floor.
Sit up tall and take a few breaths before repeating the pose or moving on to another asana.
Contraindications:

Avoid this pose if you have severe lower back, hip, or neck injuries. Always listen to your body and modify the pose as needed.
Consult with a healthcare professional if you have any concerns or pre-existing conditions that may be affected by this pose.
Modifications and Variations:
For Beginners: Keep your knees bent and your hands on the floor or the backs of your thighs for support.
For a Deeper Stretch: Straighten your legs to form a "V" shape and reach your arms forward, parallel to the floor.
