Starting Position:

Stand with your feet together or hip-width apart, depending on your comfort and stability. Ensure that your weight is evenly distributed across both feet.
Foot and Leg Alignment:

Press firmly into all four corners of your feet (big toe mound, pinky toe mound, inner heel, and outer heel).
Engage your thigh muscles and lift your kneecaps, creating a slight internal rotation of your thighs.
Pelvic Positioning:

Tuck your tailbone slightly and draw your lower abdomen in and up to engage your core muscles.
Maintain a neutral pelvis, avoiding excessive arching or rounding of the lower back.
Spine Alignment:

Lengthen your spine, imagining a string pulling the crown of your head upwards.
Keep your shoulders relaxed and away from your ears, with your shoulder blades drawing down and back.
Arm and Hand Placement:

Let your arms hang naturally at your sides with your palms facing forward. This opens up your chest and promotes proper alignment.
Alternatively, bring your palms together in front of your chest in Anjali Mudra (prayer position) for a centered and focused stance.
Head and Neck Position:

Keep your head in line with your spine, with your chin parallel to the floor.
Soften your gaze, either looking straight ahead or slightly downward.
Breathing:

Take slow, deep breaths, inhaling through your nose and exhaling through your mouth. Focus on maintaining a steady and even breath.
Use your breath to create space and relaxation in your body.
Maintaining Proper Alignment:

Check your alignment from head to toe: feet grounded, legs engaged, pelvis neutral, spine long, shoulders relaxed, and head balanced.
Periodically scan your body for tension and make adjustments as needed to maintain alignment.
Mindfulness and Focus:

Use Mountain Pose as an opportunity to center yourself and connect with your breath.
Stay present in the moment, focusing on the sensations in your body and the rhythm of your breath.
Modifications for Comfort:

If you have difficulty standing still, practice with your back against a wall for additional support and alignment feedback.
For those with balance issues, keep your feet hip-width apart rather than together.
Duration:

Hold the pose for several breaths, typically 1-2 minutes, gradually increasing the duration as your comfort and stability improve.
Contraindications:

Avoid standing for prolonged periods if you have severe balance issues or dizziness. Always listen to your body and modify the pose as needed.
Consult with a healthcare professional if you have any concerns or pre-existing conditions that may be affected by this pose.
