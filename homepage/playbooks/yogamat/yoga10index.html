Starting Position:

Begin by lying on your stomach on your yoga mat. Extend your legs straight back with the tops of your feet resting on the mat.
Allow your arms to rest alongside your body initially.
Positioning the Arms:

Slide your arms forward and place your elbows under your shoulders, forearms resting on the mat. Your arms should form a "V" shape.
Alternatively, you can stack your forearms in front of you and rest your forehead on your arms.
Leg and Foot Positioning:

Keep your legs relaxed and slightly apart. Your toes can point straight back or slightly outward for comfort.
Allow your heels to naturally fall to the sides, releasing any tension in your legs.
Spine and Hip Alignment:

Relax your lower back and hips, allowing your pelvis to sink into the mat.
Ensure that your spine remains neutral and your body feels balanced and supported.
Head and Neck Positioning:

If your forehead is resting on your arms, keep your neck in a neutral position.
If your head is lifted, make sure your neck is aligned with your spine, avoiding any unnecessary strain.
Breathing:

Take slow, deep breaths. Focus on expanding your belly with each inhale, pressing gently into the mat.
Exhale fully, allowing your body to relax deeper into the pose.
Modifications for Comfort:

If you experience discomfort in your lower back, place a folded blanket or bolster under your hips for additional support.
To alleviate neck tension, use a small pillow or folded towel under your forehead.
Mindfulness and Relaxation:

Close your eyes and focus on your breath and body sensations. Use this time to connect with your inner self and find calmness.
Allow your body to fully relax with each exhale, releasing any tension in your muscles.
Duration:

Hold the pose for several minutes, or as long as it feels comfortable. Aim for at least 5-10 minutes to fully reap the restorative benefits.
You can gradually increase the duration as your comfort and relaxation improve.
Exiting the Pose:

To come out of the pose, gently lift your head and slide your arms back alongside your body.
Roll onto your back or push yourself up into a seated position slowly to avoid any dizziness or discomfort.
Contraindications:

Avoid this pose if you have severe lower back, shoulder, or neck injuries. Always listen to your body and modify the pose as needed.
Consult with a healthcare professional if you have any concerns or pre-existing conditions that may be affected by this pose.
Modifications and Variations:
For Beginners: Use props like blankets or bolsters to support your body and make the pose more comfortable.
For a Deeper Relaxation: Combine this pose with deep breathing exercises or guided meditation for enhanced relaxation.
