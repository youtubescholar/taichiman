Starting Position:

Begin in a standing position with your feet together and arms at your sides.
Find a focal point to help with balance and focus.
Entering the Pose:

Bend your knees slightly and lift your right foot, balancing on your left leg.
Cross your right thigh over your left thigh. If possible, tuck your right foot behind your left calf. If not, rest your right toes on the floor or against your left shin for balance.
Arm Positioning:

Extend your arms forward, parallel to the floor.
Cross your left arm over your right arm at the elbows. Bend your elbows and bring your palms together. If your palms donâ€™t touch, place the backs of your hands together or hold onto your shoulders.
Spine and Hip Alignment:

Keep your spine straight and avoid rounding your back. Lengthen through the crown of your head.
Ensure your hips are square to the front, avoiding any twisting or tilting.
Maintaining Balance:

Engage your core muscles to help with stability.
Focus on your breath and maintain a steady, even pace. Use your breath to help you balance and stay centered.
Breathing:

Inhale deeply as you lengthen your spine and lift your elbows slightly.
Exhale as you deepen the bend in your knees and sink lower into the pose, keeping your back straight.
Adjusting for Comfort:

If you have difficulty balancing, practice near a wall or use a chair for support.
If wrapping your arms or legs is challenging, modify the pose by crossing at the thighs and arms without fully wrapping.
Duration:

Hold the pose for several breaths, typically 5-10 deep breaths.
Gradually increase the duration as your balance and strength improve.
Exiting the Pose:

To release, gently unwind your arms and legs and return to a standing position.
Repeat the pose on the opposite side, balancing on your right leg and crossing your left thigh over your right.
Contraindications:

Avoid this pose if you have knee, ankle, or shoulder injuries. Always listen to your body and modify the pose as needed.
Consult with a healthcare professional if you have any concerns or pre-existing conditions that may be affected by this pose.
Modifications and Variations:
For Beginners: Use a wall for support or keep your toes on the ground for better balance.
For a Deeper Stretch: Sink lower into your standing leg while keeping your spine long and straight.
Advanced Variation: Try to lift your elbows to shoulder height to deepen the stretch in your upper back and shoulders.
Benefits:
Improves balance and coordination.
Strengthens the ankles, calves, thighs, and hips.
Stretches the shoulders, upper back, and outer thighs.
Enhances focus and concentration.
