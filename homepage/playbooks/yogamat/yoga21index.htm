Starting Position:

Begin on your hands and knees in a tabletop position. Align your wrists directly under your shoulders and your knees under your hips.
Hand and Arm Placement:

Spread your fingers wide and press firmly into the mat with your entire hand, especially the index finger and thumb.
Rotate your upper arms outward, ensuring that your elbows are not locked. Engage your arms to support your shoulders.
Foot and Leg Alignment:

Tuck your toes under and slowly lift your knees off the mat. Straighten your legs as much as comfortable, aiming to bring your heels towards the floor.
Keep your feet hip-width apart, and press your heels down towards the mat, even if they don't touch.
Spine and Hip Alignment:

Lift your hips up and back, forming an inverted V-shape with your body. Lengthen your spine and avoid rounding your back.
Engage your core muscles to support your lower back and maintain stability.
Head and Neck Position:

Keep your head in line with your upper arms or slightly tucked, ensuring that your neck is relaxed. Avoid letting your head hang completely.
Gaze towards your navel or between your legs, maintaining a neutral neck position.
Breathing:

Take slow, deep breaths. Inhale to lengthen your spine and create space, and exhale to deepen the stretch.
Use your breath to help release any tension and maintain focus.
Modifications for Comfort and Stability:

If you have tight hamstrings or calves, keep a slight bend in your knees to maintain a long spine.
Use yoga blocks under your hands if you have difficulty reaching the floor or to relieve wrist pressure.
Mindfulness and Relaxation:

Focus on your breath and body sensations. Use this pose to connect with your breath and release tension.
Stay present in the moment and avoid pushing yourself too hard. Listen to your body and respect your limits.
Duration:

Hold the pose for several breaths, typically 1-3 minutes, depending on your comfort and endurance.
Gradually increase the duration as your strength and flexibility improve.
Exiting the Pose:

To come out of the pose, slowly lower your knees back to the mat into the tabletop position.
Rest in Child's Pose (Balasana) for a few breaths to release any remaining tension.
Contraindications:

Avoid this pose if you have severe wrist, shoulder, or back injuries. Always listen to your body and modify the pose as needed.
Consult with a healthcare professional if you have any concerns or pre-existing conditions that may be affected by this pose.
Modifications and Variations:
For Beginners: Keep a slight bend in your knees and lift your heels off the floor if needed.
For a Deeper Stretch: Walk your feet closer to your hands or lift one leg at a time for variations like Three-Legged Downward Dog.
