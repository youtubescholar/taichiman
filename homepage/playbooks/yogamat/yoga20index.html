Starting Position:

Begin in a High Plank position with your wrists directly under your shoulders and your body forming a straight line from head to heels.
Transition to Side Plank:

Shift your weight onto your right hand and the outer edge of your right foot.
Stack your left foot on top of your right foot, keeping your legs straight and your feet flexed.
Hand and Arm Placement:

Place your right hand firmly on the mat, ensuring that your wrist is directly under your shoulder.
Extend your left arm straight up towards the ceiling, aligning it with your right arm.
Spine and Hip Alignment:

Engage your core muscles to keep your body in a straight line. Avoid letting your hips sag or lift too high.
Keep your chest open and your shoulders stacked on top of each other.
Foot and Leg Alignment:

Press firmly into the outer edge of your right foot and engage your leg muscles to maintain stability.
Ensure that your legs remain straight and active throughout the pose.
Head and Neck Position:

Keep your head in line with your spine. You can either gaze straight ahead or up at your left hand, depending on your balance and comfort.
Breathing:

Take slow, deep breaths. Inhale to lengthen your spine and create space, and exhale to maintain stability and balance.
Use your breath to help relax any tension and deepen your focus.
Modifications for Comfort and Stability:

If you find it challenging to balance, you can lower your right knee to the mat, keeping your left leg extended for a modified version.
Use a block under your supporting hand to lift the floor closer to you if needed.
Mindfulness and Focus:

Focus on your breath and body sensations. Use this pose to build strength, balance, and concentration.
Avoid pushing yourself too hard. Listen to your body and respect your limits.
Duration:

Hold the pose for several breaths, typically 15-30 seconds.
Gradually increase the duration as your strength and stability improve.
Exiting the Pose:

To come out of the pose, exhale and return to High Plank position.
Repeat the pose on the other side, shifting your weight onto your left hand and the outer edge of your left foot.
Contraindications:

Avoid this pose if you have wrist, elbow, or shoulder injuries. Always listen to your body and modify the pose as needed.
Consult with a healthcare professional if you have any concerns or pre-existing conditions that may be affected by this pose.
Modifications and Variations:
For Beginners: Lower the bottom knee to the mat for additional support.
For a Deeper Stretch: Lift the top leg and hold it with the top hand, or perform a variation like Wild Thing.
