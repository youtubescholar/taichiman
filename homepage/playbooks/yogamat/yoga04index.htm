Setting Up Your Space:

Use a yoga mat to provide cushioning for your hands, pelvis, and feet.
Starting Position:

Begin by lying face down on your mat with your legs extended behind you, tops of your feet pressing into the mat.
Place your hands under your shoulders, fingers spread wide and elbows close to your body.
Feet and Legs:

Keep your legs together or slightly apart, with the tops of your feet pressing firmly into the mat.
Engage your quadriceps to lift your kneecaps slightly off the mat, which helps protect your lower back.
Hand Placement:

Place your hands directly under your shoulders with your fingers spread wide for a stable base.
Ensure your elbows are bent and close to your sides.
Lifting into Cobra:

On an inhalation, begin to lift your chest off the mat by straightening your arms. Keep a slight bend in your elbows to avoid locking them.
Lift only as high as you can while maintaining comfort in your lower back. Use the muscles in your back rather than pushing excessively with your hands.
Spine Alignment:

Keep your spine long and avoid overarching your lower back. Focus on lengthening through the crown of your head and lifting your chest forward and up.
Distribute the curve evenly along your entire spine, from the neck down to the lower back.
Shoulder Position:

Draw your shoulders away from your ears and down your back to avoid hunching.
Broaden your collarbones and open your chest.
Neck and Head:

Keep your neck long and in line with your spine. Avoid tilting your head back too far, which can strain your neck.
Gaze forward or slightly upward, keeping your chin slightly tucked to maintain alignment.
Breathing:

Take slow, deep breaths as you hold the pose. Inhale to lift and lengthen, and exhale to soften any tension.
Focus on expanding your chest with each inhale and grounding through your legs and feet with each exhale.
Duration:

Hold the pose for a few breaths, gradually increasing the duration as your strength and flexibility improve.
Avoid staying in the pose if you experience pain or discomfort in your lower back.
Modifications:

For a gentler variation, keep your elbows bent and closer to your body (Baby Cobra).
To increase intensity, straighten your arms more fully, but be mindful of maintaining proper alignment and avoiding strain.
Exiting the Pose:

To release, exhale and slowly lower your chest back to the mat, turning your head to one side and resting your arms by your sides.
Take a few breaths in this position before moving on to your next pose.
Contraindications:

Avoid this pose if you have severe back problems, recent abdominal surgery, or carpal tunnel syndrome.
Consult with a healthcare professional if you have any concerns or pre-existing conditions that may be affected by this pose.
