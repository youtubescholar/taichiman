Setting Up Your Space:

Use a yoga mat for cushioning.
Have a blanket or bolster nearby for additional support if needed.
Entering the Pose:

Start in a kneeling position with your big toes touching and your knees spread apart. The distance between your knees can vary depending on your comfort.
Sit back onto your heels and extend your arms forward, bringing your forehead to the mat. Alternatively, you can keep your arms alongside your body with palms facing up.
Adjusting for Comfort:

If you experience discomfort in your knees, place a folded blanket or cushion between your calves and thighs.
For more support under your chest and head, use a bolster or a stack of blankets. This is especially helpful for pregnant women or individuals with limited flexibility.
Supporting the Head and Neck:

If your forehead does not comfortably reach the mat, place a block or folded blanket under it. This will help maintain a neutral neck position.
Avoid letting your head hang or putting unnecessary strain on your neck.
Breathing:

Focus on slow, deep breaths. Inhale deeply through your nose, expanding your abdomen, and exhale fully.
Use your breath to release tension and sink deeper into the pose with each exhale.
Spine and Hip Alignment:

Ensure your spine is lengthened, not rounded. Reach your tailbone towards your heels and stretch your fingertips forward.
Keep your hips pressing down towards your heels. If your hips are far from your heels, place a bolster or folded blanket between your hips and heels for support.
Arm Variations:

Extend your arms forward with palms facing down for an active stretch.
Rest your arms alongside your body with palms facing up for a more relaxed position.
Mindfulness and Relaxation:

Close your eyes and focus on your breath and body sensations. Use this time to connect with your inner self and find calmness.
Stay in the pose for several breaths or up to a few minutes, depending on your comfort level.
Exiting the Pose:

To come out of the pose, gently lift your torso and walk your hands back towards your knees.
Slowly rise to a seated position or transition to another pose.
Contraindications:

Avoid this pose if you have severe knee injuries or conditions that prevent you from kneeling comfortably.
If you have high blood pressure or eye problems, support your head with a higher prop to avoid pressure on the forehead.
