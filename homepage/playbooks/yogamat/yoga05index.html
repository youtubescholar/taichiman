Starting Position:

Begin on your hands and knees in a tabletop position. Align your wrists directly under your shoulders and your knees directly under your hips.
Spread your fingers wide and press evenly through your hands to distribute your weight and protect your wrists.
Knee and Foot Placement:

Keep your knees hip-width apart and your feet relaxed with the tops of your feet resting on the mat.
Engage your core muscles to support your spine and maintain a neutral position.
Hand and Arm Positioning:

Position your hands shoulder-width apart and press firmly into the mat. This helps stabilize your upper body and protect your wrists.
Ensure your arms are straight, but keep a micro-bend in your elbows to avoid locking your joints.
Spine Movement:

As you exhale, gently round your spine towards the ceiling, tucking your tailbone and drawing your belly button in towards your spine.
Drop your head, bringing your chin towards your chest. This is the cat part of the pose, focusing on creating an arch in your back.
Breathing:

Inhale deeply through your nose and exhale fully as you move into the pose. Focus on coordinating your breath with your movements.
Use your breath to help you deepen the stretch and release tension.
Shoulder and Neck Position:

Draw your shoulder blades away from your ears and towards your spine, creating space and reducing tension in your neck and shoulders.
Keep your neck relaxed, allowing it to follow the movement of your spine naturally.
Modifications for Comfort:

If you experience discomfort in your wrists, place a folded blanket or towel under your hands for extra cushioning.
You can also come onto your fists or use yoga blocks under your hands to reduce pressure on your wrists.
Mindfulness and Relaxation:

Close your eyes and focus on your breath and the sensations in your body. Use this pose to connect with your breath and release any stress or tension.
Stay present in the moment and avoid rushing through the movements.
Transitioning to Other Poses:

Cat Pose is often paired with Cow Pose (Bitilasana) for a gentle spinal warm-up. On your inhale, move into Cow Pose by arching your back and lifting your head and tailbone towards the ceiling.
Alternate between Cat and Cow poses, moving with your breath for several rounds to create a flowing sequence.
Contraindications:

Avoid this pose if you have severe neck or back injuries. Always listen to your body and modify the pose as needed.
Consult with a healthcare professional if you have any concerns or pre-existing conditions that may be affected by this pose.
