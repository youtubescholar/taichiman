Starting Position:

Begin in a seated position with your legs extended straight out in front of you.
Sit on a folded blanket or cushion if your hips are tight or if it helps you sit with a straight spine.
Leg and Foot Positioning:

Bend your right knee and bring the sole of your right foot to the inside of your left thigh. Let your right knee drop out to the side.
Keep your left leg extended straight, with the toes pointing towards the ceiling and the kneecap facing upwards.
Spine and Hip Alignment:

Sit up tall, lengthening your spine. Ensure that your pelvis is neutral, neither tilting forward nor backward.
Square your hips towards your extended leg.
Arm and Hand Placement:

Inhale, reaching your arms up overhead to lengthen your spine further.
As you exhale, hinge at your hips and begin to fold forward over your extended leg. Reach your hands towards your foot, shin, or ankle, depending on your flexibility.
Maintaining Proper Alignment:

Avoid rounding your back. Instead, focus on maintaining length in your spine as you fold forward.
If you feel strain in your lower back, use a strap around the ball of your foot to help maintain alignment and avoid overstretching.
Breathing:

Take slow, deep breaths. Inhale to lengthen your spine and create space, and exhale to fold deeper into the stretch.
Use your breath to relax any tension and sink further into the pose with each exhale.
Modifications for Comfort:

If you cannot reach your foot comfortably, use a strap or belt around your foot and hold onto it with both hands.
Place a rolled-up blanket or block under your bent knee for additional support if your knee does not comfortably touch the floor.
Mindfulness and Relaxation:

Close your eyes and focus on your breath and body sensations. Use this pose to connect with your breath and release any tension in your body.
Stay present in the moment and avoid forcing yourself deeper into the stretch. Listen to your body and respect your limits.
Duration:

Hold the pose for several breaths, typically 1-3 minutes.
Gradually increase the duration as your flexibility and comfort improve.
Exiting the Pose:

To come out of the pose, inhale to lift your torso back up to a seated position.
Extend your right leg out in front of you and shake out both legs before repeating the pose on the other side.
Contraindications:

Avoid this pose if you have severe lower back or knee injuries. Always listen to your body and modify the pose as needed.
Consult with a healthcare professional if you have any concerns or pre-existing conditions that may be affected by this pose.
Modifications and Variations:
For Beginners: Use a strap around your foot to help maintain proper alignment and avoid overstretching.
For a Deeper Stretch: Flex your foot and press through your heel to engage your leg muscles more actively.
Advanced Variation: Try to bring your torso closer to your extended leg by deepening the forward fold, keeping your spine long.
