I've been to a lot of different workshops and group meetings for a wide variety of topics.

The flowshop template is designed to minimize the distracting problems that are self-evident in groups.

In general, you need different methodologies for teaching and learning depending on your group sizes.

If the group of people is larger than 6, consider using other approaches.

I've had the opportunity to learn martial arts in groups as big as 50 and as small as 3.

In my experience, it seems significantly more beneficial to learn martial arts skills in smaller groups, 3-6 people.

The numbers I'm using aren't set in stone. Also, the methodology that I'm reviewing isn't set in stone either.

Understand that there's a difference between interacting and learning together in real life, versus learning from reading or videos.

Writing, videos, and media in general allow the creator to make detailed instructions regarding performance. Consider how that's self-reinforcing, for better or for worse.

It's useful to have your own perspective. You and your safety are always first.

Consider the differences between how you would cue someone who is reading instructions from a book versus how you cue somebody who is in action doing the movement. For more information about this, I recommend reviewing motor learning principles: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_learning" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Motor Learning</a>

Also, remember that one size doesn't fit all. Talk clearly, help others when they need it, and trust that good practices make sure nothing is wasted.

Before the meeting or at the start of the meeting, choose the topic of learning.

For me, I'm going to use my framework system of playbooks, but as long as the group has a clear goal and purpose, it's fine. You could have sub-goals with the playbooks to adjust the focus of the group if that's necessary. Obviously, if you already have a group and have a procedure that works, just keep doing that.

Topics:

Seated, Everyday Module, Wellness, Yoga Mat, Fitness, Performance, Defense, Shows, Meditation, Lifelong.

Choose a routine you want to perform, give your group at least 60 minutes to complete this process.

Warm up: Complete a warm-up routine that is achievable and gives a just-right challenge.

Play: Do a lively or establishing routine that the group is familiar with.

Break: Allow a quick break, water, etc.

Regroup: Confirm the readiness of the group and state the purpose of the group for that instance.

Teach: Provide the real-time instructions and demonstrations of the routine. It's important to complete the whole task if possible. Allow people who are beginning to participate with whole practice, allowing for watching with the participation.

Sharing: Inquire if the group is comfortable while performing; no technical questions. Does each person in the group confirm that they are ready to train? Establish that each person in the group is confident that they believe it's feasible to learn this.

Advance: Continue teaching the routine, or move on to the next topic if the group is ready for another topic to be covered.

Processing: Explore what makes it easier for people to learn. You can use open-ended questions and explore if people notice any novel features of a form.

Cooldown: Do a brief meditation, or do a routine that is generally accepted as a cooldown.

Summary: Confirm learning and prepare for the next meetup.

Of course, this isn't set in stone. For example, take as many breaks as needed. These are just my reflections regarding groups in general.

After the session, review these statements. They aren't set in stone, and you don't have to use all of them. This is just a humble attempt to be comprehensive when processing after the fact:

Fill in the routine name, choose a modifier between the /lines/:

[Insert Routine here] is a routine of interest.

To me, it's /a big/a steady/somewhat of an/ effort.

It is /very/quite/somewhat/ curious.

It is /very/quite/somewhat/ exciting.

It is /very/quite/somewhat/ clear.

It is /very/quite/somewhat/ enjoyable.

It is /very/quite/somewhat/ engaging.

It is /very/quite/somewhat/ helpful.

It is /very/quite/somewhat/ satisfying.

Depending on how you choose or don't choose the statements, that could inform how to best approach the next meetup.

Stay curious and stay safe out there.
