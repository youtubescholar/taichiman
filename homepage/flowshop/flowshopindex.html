I've been to a lot of different workshops and group meetings for a wide variety of topics.
The flowshop template is designed to minimize the distracting problems that are self-evident in groups.
In general, you need different methodologies for teaching and learning depending on your group sizes.
If the group of people is larger than 6, consider using other approaches.  
I've had the opportunity to learn martial arts in groups as big as 50 and as small as 3.
In my experience, it seems significantly more beneficial to learn martial art skills in smaller groups, 3-6 people.
The numbers I'm using aren't set in stone.  Also, the methodology that I'm reviewing isn't set in stone either.
Understand that there's a difference between interacting and learning together in real life, versus learning from reading or videos. 
Writing, videos, and media in general allows for that creator to make detailed instructions regarding performance.  Consider how that's self-reinforcing, for better or for worse.
It's useful to have your own perspective.  You and your safety is always first. 
Consider the differences between how you would cue someone who is reading instructions from a book,
versus how you cue somebody who is in action doing the movement.  For more information about this, I recommend
reviewing motor learning principles: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_learning  
Also remember that one size doesn't fit all, have a routine that takes care of things so there's no waste.  

Before the meeting or at the start of the meeting, choose the topic of learning.
For me, I'm going to use my framework system of playbooks, but so long as the group has a clear goal and
purpose it's fine.  You could have sub-goals with the playbooks to adjust the focus of the group if that's 
necessary.  Obviously if you already have a group and have a routine that works, just keep doing that. 

Topics:
  Seated, Everyday Module, Wellness, Yoga Mat, Fitness, Performance, Defense, Shows, Meditation, Lifelong.
  Choose a routine you want to perform, give your group at least 60 minutes to complete this process.

  1. Warm up: Complete a warm-up routine that is achievable and gives a just right challenge
  2. Play: Do a lively or establishing routine that the group is familiar with
  3. Break: Allow a quick break, water, etc.  
  4. Regroup: Confirm the readiness of the group and state the purpose of the group for that instance
  5. Teach: Provide the real-time instructions and demonstrations of the routine, it's important to complete the whole task if possible.  Allow people who are beginning to participate with whole practice, allow for watching with the participation
  6. Sharing: Inquire if the group is comfortable while performing, no technical questions, does each person in the group confirm that they are ready to train.  Establish that each person in the group is confident that they believe it's feasible to learn this.
  7. Advance: Continue teaching routine, or move on to next topic if the group is ready for another topic to be covered.
  8. Processing: Explore what makes it easier for people to learn.  You can use open ended questions, explore if people notice any novel features of a form. 
  9. Cooldown: Do a brief meditation, or do a routine that is generally accepted as a cooldown.  
  10. Summary: Confirm learning and prepare for next meet up.

  Of course this isn't set in stone. For example, take as many breaks as needed. This is just my reflections regarding groups in general.
  
  After the session, review these statements, they aren't set in stone, and you don't have to use all of them,
  just a humble attempt to be comprehensive when processing after the fact:
Fill in the routine name, choose a modifier between the /lines/:  
    
[Insert Routine here] is a routine of interest.
To me, it's /a big/a steady/somewhat of an/ effort.  
It is /very/quite/somewhat/ curious. 
It is /very/quite/somewhat/ exciting.  
It is /very/quite/somewhat/ clear.  
It is /very/quite/somewhat/ enjoyable.  
It is /very/quite/somewhat/ engaging.  
It is /very/quite/somewhat/ helpful.  
It is /very/quite/somewhat/ satisfying.  

Depending how you choose the statements, that could inform how to best approach the next meet up.
If any of those aspects are lacking, then the teaching methodology might not be working.  Stay curious.
